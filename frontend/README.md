# A React website created for a client


## Front End

For the front end I used React and Tailwind CSS. I decided to use Tailwind CSS to explore a new responsive framework that would be consistent. It also allowed for numerous different animations. 

## Back End

For the back end fo the website I utilized NodeJS as well as a MongoDB database.
